            <h2>About This Website</h2>
            <p>This site started as a playground for learning the absolute basics of the web stack and has grown into a living archive of experiments, prototypes, and notes from the journey.</p>

            <h3>Development Story</h3>
            <p>The project kicked off with static HTML pages that documented each small breakthrough. As new ideas surfaced, the site absorbed them: stylesheets were refactored, JavaScript utilities were shared across pages, and an embedded React sandbox was introduced to document modern component explorations. Every branch of the repository doubles as documentation of what was tried, why it mattered, and what was left behind for future reflection.</p>

            <h3>Documentation &amp; Resources</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Project source, issues, and dev logs live in the <a href="https://github.com/idealase/idealase.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub repository</a>.</li>
                <li>Historical context for the "First JS" prototype, including notes on the original vanilla JavaScript widgets, resides in <a href="documents.html">the documents section</a>.</li>
                <li>Experiments with authentication, security headers, and testing are captured across the <code>tests/</code> folder and the linked reports.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What You Can Explore</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Timeline snapshots of each refactor and technology spike.</li>
                <li>Comparisons between static and React-driven interfaces.</li>
                <li>Security hardening notes, accessibility checklists, and lessons learned.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="whisper">Psst... the backstage <a href="login.html">portal</a> is tucked away right here for those who know to look.</p>
