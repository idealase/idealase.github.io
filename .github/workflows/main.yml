name: Website CI/CD Pipeline

# Streamlined CI/CD focusing on PR automation and essential deployment
# - PR triggers: Comprehensive checks before merge (security, tests, build validation)
# - Push to main: Deployment only (assumes checks passed in PR)
# This eliminates duplicate deployment workflows and race conditions

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    # Only deploy on push to main, not for general CI checks
